        <h3>Adapts Well To Apartment Lifestyle</h3>

        <p>Contrary to popular belief, small size doesn’t necessarily an apartment dog make. 
            Plenty of small dogs are too high-energy and yappy for life in a high-rise. 
            Being quiet, low energy, fairly calm indoors, 
            and polite with the other residents are all good qualities in an apartment dog. 
            And you can find an awesome crate for your dog here to 
            give them a little more personal space in your apartment.

        <h3>Intelligence</h3>
        <p>Dogs who were bred for jobs that require decision making, intelligence, and concentration, 
            such as herding livestock, need to exercise their brains, just as dogs who were bred to run all day need to exercise their bodies. 
            If they don’t get the mental stimulation they need, they’ll make their own work–usually with projects you won’t like, 
            such as digging and chewing. 
            Obedience training and interactive dog toys are good ways to give a dog a brain workout, 
            as are dog sports and careers, such as agility and search and rescue. See Dogs Who Have Lower Intelligence

        <h3>Easy To Groom</h3>
        <p>Some breeds are brush-and-go dogs; others require regular bathing, 
            clipping, and other grooming just to stay clean and healthy. 
            Consider whether you have the time and patience for a dog who needs
            a lot of grooming, or the money to pay someone else to do it.
